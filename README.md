# wolfram-librarylink-examples

LibraryLink is a tool which lets you extend the Wolfram Language with C/C++ libraries. This
repository is a collection of examples which show how you to do this. It is useful for developers
who want to either add their own C/C++ functions to the Wolfram Language *or* want to incorporate
functionality from an existing C/C++ library.

Open the Examples directory to see the examples and how to build them.
